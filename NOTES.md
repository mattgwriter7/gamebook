# NOTES 
This is a place for stuff that doesn't fit under README

## NAMING CONVENTIONS
* variables are "lowercase_with_hyphens"
* methods are "camelCased()"...
* programming classes should be capitalized, and always have the filename exactly match the class name (so the "Config" class is "Config.dart", for instance)
  + But, CSS classes will be "lowercase_with_hyphens"
* REALLY_IMPORTANT variables can be all caps and underscored
   + but there should only be 1 or 2 "really important" variables in an app
