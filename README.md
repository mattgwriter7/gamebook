## DETAILS
This project takes inspiration from the gamebooks like 
"Fighting Fantasy" by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone from the early 1980s, although the story genre is unimportant.

The goal is to have a Flutter App that accepts a "story key" (4-8 characters, like "A7YT4") and then fetches the corresponding story.  There will be a DEFAULT story for the first time a user runs the App.  

Stories will be completed passage-by-passage as a user makes a choice from the preceding passage.  Each choice will have a "passage key" which will fetch the corresponding passage using JSON.
